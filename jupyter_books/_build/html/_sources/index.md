# Welcome To The World Of Recommendations and Ranking

In most companies like OKKO (my current workpalce) or Netflix, we aim to to promote relevant content
to users such that they can spend leisure time by watching interesting titles. Also, we want to find
relevant title by users' search query and put it on top so that minimum effort is needed
to start watching the title. Yet, in many other industries such as e-commerce, banking etc.
recommending relevant products or helping to find necessary service signifficantly increase
user satisfaction and/or sales.

Basically, these two problems can be considered as a ranking problem. In the first case,
we have to rank titles based on users' preference. In the second one, we have to rank the
most similar to query and most likely to be clicked/watched. In this hand book, we will dive into
these two topics and learn how to code it as well.

## Self-Introduction

Hi! I am Shuhrat, as of today, Lead Machine Learning Engineer at online cinema OKKO.
During my journey as a Machine Learning Engineer I had vast experienece in various 
industries like banking, metal & mining, consulting, two-sided marketplace and
finally -- online streaming platofrm OKKO.

I got my masters at [International School of Economics and Finance](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/financial/)
(Higher School of Economics) and before that BSc in Economics minoring in Data Science

## Motivation behind this handbook
In most projects where I was involved classic ML models were used and there are so
many guides and handbooks about them that is very easy to get started researching.
However, recommendations and ranking problem take special place among other
problems because they face many difficulties in production-ready usage: custom
backend architecture, data streaming, runtime latency, heavy models for embeddings etc.
Unfortunately, I could not find a resource where all this knowledge would be up-to-date
with overview of various algorithms explained in theory and backed up by code.
Therefore, I decided to refresh everything I did and learn and structure into
useful handbook. First of all, it will help me to understand and memorize most stuff
efficiently. Also, it may help many of you to get to know this field
in ML and even allow to develop good perfoming models in production.

In addition, I tried to simplify hard topics so that as much folks as possible would be able
to process the content. Well, I am not math and tech guy myself as you can see
from my degrees :) (even though math in our uni was hell!)

Thus, in this hand book you will find understandable overview of most popular topics
in recommendation and ranking with practical examples in jupyter notebooks.
